# PPO-Representation-Learning
This project explores how dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and autoencoders can improve the training efficiency and performance of PPO agents in reinforcement learning. We compare a baseline PPO agent using raw state inputs with agents using compressed observations in the CartPole environment, with plans to extend to Walker2D.
